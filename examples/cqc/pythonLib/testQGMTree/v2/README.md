## Version v2

In this version each node can suffer a local violation and each sub-tree maintains its own sub-global state without communicating it to the upper or lower nodes.
Unlike the main version, no log files are created here.

*NOTE: this project is no longer updated.*

## Instructions

Please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/qis-unipr/QuantumNetworking/blob/master/examples/cqc/pythonLib/testQGMTree/README.md) file of the main version.
